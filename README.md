# 🚗 Parking Availability Prediction

This project predicts real-time parking occupancy levels using live sensor data, historical traffic congestion, and weather conditions in Aarhus.

## 📂 Project Files

- `DSP_PPO_API.ipynb` – Main notebook for merging datasets and running predictive models
- `weather_data.csv` – Hourly weather data with classified conditions
- `traffic_congestion.csv` – Hourly traffic congestion data
- `merged_dataset_preview.png` – Sample of the final merged dataset
- `model_comparison.png` – Accuracy comparison of Random Forest, Ridge, XGBoost models
- `occupancy_dashboard.png` – Forecast visualization from dashboard prototype

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Ridge Regression)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
- Real-time dataset merging & model evaluation

## 🧠 Goal
To help drivers or city planners estimate future parking occupancy for smart traffic management.
